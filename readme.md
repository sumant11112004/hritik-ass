Problem Statement: Anime Explorer – Interactive Anime Discovery App 
Objective: 
Build a fully functional and interactive iOS application using the Jikan API (base URL: 
https://api.jikan.moe/v4) to allow users to explore and interact with anime data in 
real-time. 
Description: 
The goal is to develop a live iOS app that enables users to search, view, and interact with 
anime-related content fetched from the Jikan API. The app should emphasize clean UI/UX, 
real-time updates, and smooth navigation across different views. 
Users should be able to: 
1. Search for anime titles using keywords. 
2. View detailed information about selected anime — including title, synopsis, rating, 
episodes, and genres. 
3. Explore popular, upcoming, and top-rated anime lists through categorized tabs or 
sections. 
4. Add anime to a “Favorites” or “Watchlist” section, stored locally on the device. 
5. (Bonus) Display character details or related anime using additional endpoints from the 
API. 
Requirements: 
● Use Swift or SwiftUI for UI implementation. 
● Fetch live data from https://api.jikan.moe/v4 using URLSession or Alamofire. 
● Implement asynchronous API calls with proper error handling and loading states. 
● Design a responsive, visually appealing interface (bonus for animations and 
transitions). 
● Store user interactions (favorites/watchlist) using Core Data or UserDefaults. 
● Maintain proper code architecture (MVVM or MVC preferred). 
Evaluation Criteria: 
● Functionality and API integration 
● UI/UX design and responsiveness 
● Code quality, structure, and comments 
● Performance and loading optimization 
● Creativity in data presentation (charts, cards, grids, etc.) 
Bonus Features (Optional): 
● Implement dark mode support 
● Add infinite scroll or pagination for anime lists 
● Use image caching for faster loading 
● Integrate anime trailers or opening theme music preview via embedded media player
